# Netflix-Appetency

This notebook is my attempt for the netflix change on Kaggle, link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/netflix-appetency.

I would you this file for my notes as I walk/process the dataset.

- First I read the dataset, the dataset has 2 files train & test in csv format.
- train.csv conatins **70000** records with **508** feature columns & **target** column for classification.
- test.sc contains **30000** records with **508** columns.
- Next we would go into pre-processing:
     - checking the nulls: The train data has 73 columns which has missing values.
